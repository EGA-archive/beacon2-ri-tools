# SUMMARY

A script that converts Phenopacket PXF (JSON) to BFF (JSON).

Note that PXF contain one individual per file (1 JSON document), whereas BFF (majoritarily) contain multiple inviduals per file (JSON array of documentsa). Thus, the input should be PXF JSON from, say, the same dataset, and the output will be a unique `individuals.json` file.

_NB:_ The script was created to parse [RD\_Connect synthetic data](https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD00001008392). See examples in the `in` and `out` directories. 

The script is **UNTESTED** for other PXFs. Please use at your own risk!

**UPDATE**: The author is working in an improved version in the form of a CPAN module. Please take a look [here](https://github.com/mrueda/Convert-Pheno).

# HOW TO RUN PXF2BFF

The script runs on command-line Linux (tested on Debian-based distribution). Perl 5 is installed by default on Linux,
but we will need to install a few CPAN modules.

First we install cpanminus (with sudo privileges):

    $ sudo apt-get install cpanminus

Second we use cpanm to install the CPAN modules:

    $ cpanm --sudo --installdeps .

If you prefer to have the dependencies in a "virtual environment" (i.e., install the CPAN modules in the directory of the application) we recommend using the module Carton.

    $ cpanm --sudo Carton

Then, we can install our dependencies:

    $ carton install

For executing `pxf2bff` you will need:

- Input file(s):

    A list of Phenopacket JSON files (normally from the same dataset). Note that PXFs only contain ONE individual per file.

**Examples:**

    $ ./pxf2bff -i in/*json -o out

    $ $path/pxf2bff -i file.json --out-dir my_bff_outdir

    $ $path/pxf2bff -i my_indir/*json -o my_bff_outdir 

    $ carton exec -- $path/pxf2bff -i my_indir/*json -o my_bff_outdir # if using Carton
